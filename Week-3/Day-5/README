#DAY 5 - RESPONSIVE DESIGN

What I Implemented:
> Used percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels
> Applied CSS Media Queries for different screen resolutions
> Converted layout from horizontal to vertical for smaller screens
> Tested the webpage in mobile view using browser tools
> Improved readability and user experience across devices


Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Flexbox
* Media Queries


Learning Outcome:
This task helped me understand how modern websites adapt to different devices.
Now I can design layouts that are flexible, user-friendly and mobile-compatible.


Result:
The webpage successfully responds to:
*  Desktop Screens
*  Mobile Devices
*  Tablets

The layout automatically resizes and rearranges content based on screen size.
