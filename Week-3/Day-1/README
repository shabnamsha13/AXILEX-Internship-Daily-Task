Day 1 – Introduction to HTML

#Description:
Today’s task was to learn the basics of HTML and understand how a simple webpage is created.
I created a web page using basic HTML tags such as heading, paragraph, image, and link.
I also practiced creating ordered and unordered lists and designed a table to display student details.

#What I practiced:
* Structure of an HTML document
* Using common tags like <h1>, <p>, <img>, <a>
* Creating ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists
* Designing a table using <table>, <tr>, <th> and <td>

#Learning Outcome:
This task helped me understand how HTML is used to structure content on a webpage and how different elements are displayed in the browser.
