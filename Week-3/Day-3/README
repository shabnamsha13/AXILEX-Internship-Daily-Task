Day 3- Applying CSS to Web Pages

Task:
Styling was added through CSS to shape how elements look on the current HTML page. Visual flow got a boost by adjusting spacing, fonts, and structure using stylesheet rules. Layout shifted into better form once design tweaks were applied alongside original markup.

Concepts Learned:
Using External CSS
Linking CSS with the link tag
One way is through features such as:
- margin
- padding
- text-align
- background-color
- border
Basic page layout and alignment
Improving UI using simple styling techniques

Outcome:
A clean look emerged when basic HTML got dressed up with CSS. Simple choices guided the styling, yet clarity stayed front and center. The layout shifted without losing its straightforward feel. Visual order appeared through careful spacing and type choices. Each element found its place by following quiet design rules. 

Files Used:
- index.html
- style.css
