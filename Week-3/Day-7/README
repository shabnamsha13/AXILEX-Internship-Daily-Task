The website gives tips on how to keep a healthy and productive routine during Ramadan.

Characteristics:

>JavaScript for validating forms
>Messages that tell users what to do

Technologies Used: HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3

1. Go to the project folder.
2. Click on the file called home.html twice to open it. Your browser will open on its own.
