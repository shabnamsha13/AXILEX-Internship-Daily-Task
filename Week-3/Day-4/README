DAY 4 - LAYOUT DESIGN

# Task:
Today I created a basic webpage layout using HTML and CSS.
The aim was to understand how to divide a webpage into sections and apply styling using the CSS Box Model.


# What I Did:
  * Used <div> tags to structure the webpage.
  * Created four main sections:
    * Header – Shows the title of the page
    * Navigation Bar – Contains menu links
    * Content Section – Displays the main information
    * Footer – Shows closing details
  * Applied CSS styling to make the layout neat and centered.
  * Used spacing techniques to improve readability and appearance.


# Concepts Used (CSS Box Model):
  * Margin -> Space between sections
  * Padding -> Space inside the content box
  * Border -> Defined the edges of sections
  * Box-sizing -> Helped control proper element size


# File Created:
  * layout.html – Contains the complete layout design and styling.


# Learning Outcome:
  * Learned how to structure a webpage using div-based layout.
  * Understood how margin, padding, and borders affect design.
  * Gained practical knowledge of how real websites are arranged.
  * Improved my understanding of aligning and spacing elements.


#Conclusion:
  -This task helped me build a strong foundation in webpage layout design.
  -I understood how HTML and CSS work together to create a clean and user-friendly interface.
