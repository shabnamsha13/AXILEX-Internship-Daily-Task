Expected Outcome: It should organize student information neatly using dictionary format.

2. add, update & delete elements-
Actual outcome: I was able to add new items, update existing values, and delete items from the dictionary without any errors.
Expected outcome: The program should help to easily change the dictionary data and show the final result after all operations.

3. count word frquency using dictionary-
Actual outcome: The program counted how many times each word appeared in the sentence.
Expected outcome: It should analyze the text and display the frequency of each word clearly.

4. perform set operations-
Actual outcome: All the set operations worked correctly and gave the right results.
Expected outcome: The program should perform union, intersection, difference, and other set operations correctly.

Final Outcome: All the programs ran successfully and helped me understand how dictionaries and sets are used in Python for storing data and performing operations.
